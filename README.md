# DNA-Splice-Detector---Machine-Learning-for-Nucleotide-Sequence-Classification
The DNA Splice Detector is a Python-based machine learning project designed to classify nucleotide sequences and detect potential splice sites. Using a Naive Bayes classifier, this model estimates class probabilities and computes log-likelihood scores to make predictions on DNA sequence data.
